# Potato Bot Mk1 - Model Notes

This file documents the models being used in the project as of November 13, 2025.

## Language Models (LLMs)

The main logic for conversation, curation, and reflection is handled by local LLMs run through Ollama.

- **Model:** `llama3:8b`
- **File:** `mk1/ui/app.py`
- **Usage:** This is currently the default model for all three core tasks: generating the bot's main response, curating memories, and reflecting on persona changes. We can configure stronger models (e.g., for the Reflector) here if needed.

## Embedding Model

This model is used to convert text (memories, user input) into vector embeddings for similarity searches (RAG).

- **Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **File:** `mk1/models.py`
- **Usage:** This is a small, fast, and effective model from the `sentence-transformers` library. It's loaded once and used by the `EpisodicMemoryManager` for searching and by the `Curator` when creating new memory embeddings.
