 Error parsing curation response from LLM: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
   Raw response was: Here is the analysis and response:

**Extract & Contextualize**

From the conversation, I extracted the following essential new fact:

* User's name is "Potato".

Synthesizing this information into a well-written, standalone memory:

"User's name is Potato."

**Compare & Update**

Since there are no existing memories to compare with, we don't need to update or remove any memories.

**Output Format**

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "memories_to_add": ["User's name is Potato."],
  "ids_to_remove": []
}
```
Memory updates applied: 0 added, 0 removed.

**Extract & Contextualize**

* Essential new fact: User loves Japanese ramen, especially tonkotsu style.

Synthesized memory: "User's favorite type of ramen is Japanese, with a preference for the tonkotsu style."

**Compare & Update**

* Since there are no existing memories, this new information does not contradict or update any existing memories. It simply adds a new piece of knowledge to the user's profile.

**Output Format**

Here's my response in JSON format:

```
{
  "memories_to_add": ["User's favorite type of ramen is Japanese, with a preference for the tonkotsu style."],
  "ids_to_remove": []

The new information is "User prefers to use light mode for their UI". This can be synthesized into a standalone memory: "User's preferred UI theme is light mode."

**Compare & Update**

Since there are no existing memories, this new information does not contradict or update any existing memories. Therefore, we only need to create a new memory.

**Output Format**

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
    "memories_to_add": ["User's preferred UI theme is light mode."],
    "ids_to_remove": []

   Raw response was: Here's the analysis and response:

**Extract & Contextualize**

The new information extracted from the conversation is that the user has changed their mind and now prefers dark mode.       

A good memory to create based on this information would be: "User's preferred interface theme is dark mode."

**Compare & Update**

Since there are no existing memories, we don't need to compare or update anything. We can simply add a new memory.

**Output Format**

Here's the response in JSON format:

```
{
    "memories_to_add": ["User's preferred interface theme is dark mode."],
    "ids_to_remove": []
}
